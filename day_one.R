#welcome to NMC 245
#this is what a script file looks like, you don't need to be scared of it. 

#today we will look at a few key functions

#but first dan will give us a tour of the interface. 
one<-""
two<-""
three<-""
four<-""

#how do we get things into four
#command + enter OR highligh the line and press run

#what if we want to use code that we didn't write or code to do more cool stuff?
#we access packages, lets do that now
library(nycflights13)

#accessing help, how?

#how many functions are in here...
