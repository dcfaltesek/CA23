1,"1989","All You Had To Do Was Stay","This is another way I've written songs recently. This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me"". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that"". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this_I wish you knew that_Do you like it!?_It's 2 am, in your car_Windows down, past my street the memories start_It's in the past_You drive straight ahead_You thinking that I hate you now_Cause you still don't know what I never said_I wish you would come back_Wish I never hung up the phone like I did_People like you always want back_All you had to do was stay_Had me in the palm of your hand_Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?(Stay!) Hey_Now, you say you want it back_Now that it's just too late_Well, could've been easy_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_The love they gave away_All you had to do was stay_Here you are now, calling me up_But I don't know what to say_I've been picking up the pieces_Of the mess you made_People like you always want back_The love they pushed aside_But people like me are gone forever_When you say goodbye_(Stay!) Hey_And people like me wanna believe you_All you had to do was stay_Had me in the palm of your hand_Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?(Stay!) Hey_Now, you say you want it back_Now that it's just too late_Well, could've been easy_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay! stay! stay! stay! stay!)_When you say you've changed_Let me remind you_This was what you wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)_You ended it_You were all I wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)_But not like this_Not like this_Not like this_Oh, all you had to do was_(Stay!) Hey_All you had to do was stay_The more I think about it now_Had me in the palm of your hand_Then, why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?(Stay!) Hey_Now, you say you want it back_Now that it's just too late_Well, could've been easy_All you had to do was_(Stay!) Hey_All you had to do was stay_Had me in the palm of your hand_Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?(Stay!) Hey_The less I know_Now, you say you want it back_Now that it's just too late_(All you had to do was stay)_Well, could've been easy_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!) (Oh)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!) (Ooh)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All I know is that you drove us_Off the road_(Stay!) Hey"

8,"1989","Out Of The Woods","So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together_And you come and sing and listen_I would not think about it but I'm not done_Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I_Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes_And guns_They are the hunters we are the foxes_And we run_Baby, I know places we won't be found_And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down_Cause I, I know places we can hide_I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places"". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song""Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:_I know places, I know places_Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, no places_Or whatever I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark, lyric like bridge thing and it's about like everyone is trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus. So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing_Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i_Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i_Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i_Na na na na waiting at the back door_They're around and the vultures come around_And you know that they won't, they won't us_Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us_Looking at it now_Are we out of the woods yet?

9,"1989","Shake It Off","So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called ""Blank Space,"" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the ""Oh!"" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called ""Blank Space.""""Nice to meet you, where you been?_Don't believe what you hear about me, hear about me'Cause it's gonna be forever, or gonna go -Yeah! Hey, hey!Gonna go down in flames_You can tell me when it's over -This is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track_Long list of ex-love -_Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane_But I've got a blank space, baby_*Click* I'll write your name_I've got a blank space, baby_*Click* I'll write your name""_That's awesome!
